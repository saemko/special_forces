        <p>special operations military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, trained, and equipped forces, 
            manned with selected personnel, using unconventional tactics, techniques, and modes of employment.</p>

           <p> <b>special operations</b> military activities conducted by specially designated, organized, trained and equipped forces using operational techniques and modes of employment not standard to conventional forces. These activities are conducted across 
            the full range of military operations 
            independently or in coordination with operations of conventional forces to achieve political, military, psychological and economic objectives. Politico-military considerations may require clandestine, covert or
             discreet techniques and the acceptance of a degree of physical and political risk not associated with conventional operations.</p>

             <p><b>special-operations forces</b> strategic formations and units of the armed forces, whose role is to conduct sabotage, reconnaissance, subversive and other special operations on the territory of foreign countries. In wartime they may also be assigned tasks such as intelligence-gathering,
                  the seizure or destruction of key installations, the conduct of psychological operations or the organization of insurgencies in the enemy's rear area. 
                 The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation have separate special-operations forces brigades, battalions and companies which are integrated with the intelligence assets of military districts, fronts, fleets, armies or corps.</p>
